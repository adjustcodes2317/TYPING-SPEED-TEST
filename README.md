# Typing Speed Test in Python

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **Typing Speed Test Application**.  
It measures the user's:
- Total time taken to type a paragraph
- Words Per Minute (WPM)
- Typing accuracy based on word comparison

This program is designed as a simple command-line tool for beginners learning Python, time calculation, user input handling, and basic string processing.

---

## Features
- Displays a fixed paragraph for the user to type.
- Records how long the user takes to type the paragraph.
- Calculates:
  - **Time taken (in minutes)**
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
  - **Accuracy (%)**
- Compares the typed words with the original paragraph word-by-word.

## How It Works
1. The user presses ENTER to start.
2. The program stores the starting time.
3. The user types the paragraph shown.
4. The program stores the ending time.
5. Using the time difference, WPM is calculated.
6. Accuracy is determined by comparing typed words with original words.
